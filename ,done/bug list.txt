urgent bugs:
- messing around with too much in the start menu stuff causes the camera to stop panning

meh whatever bugs:
- fix up the font a bit more (Lv, PKMN, POKEBLOCK, parentheses, colon, semicolon, &, pp)
- pokedex searching in general (fix up the order lists)
- animation for sticky barb sticking doesn't work like thief's entirely, currently the animation is commented out
- go through each move description and edit for space as necessary

day/night bugs:
- every blending thing needs to be adapted for the new dynamic palette system
- when an applymovement is used, the player gets blended with the colors (when inside)
- when a battle starts, the black covering is still blended

TODO:
- load different icons based on major gender difference
- meowstic/wormadam gender difference
- giratina/arceus formes, form(e)s in general
- daycare effects for destiny knot & power items
- 47 gen v effects?
- 23 gen vi effects?

BATTLE BUGS:

consider erasing the hp boxes when battle is happening as opposed to just letting the move animation take place

move animations that i personally want to polish:
gyro ball (new particle?)
punishment is slash w a purple blend
maybe toxic spikes?
gravity doesn't make everyone go down

move effects that need to be polished:

Generation I introduced 165 moves; 
Generation II introduced 86 moves; 
Generation III introduced 103 moves; 
Generation IV introduced 113 moves; 
Generation V introduced 92 moves; 
Generation VI introduced 62 moves; 
and Generation VII introduced 107 moves, including 35 Z-Moves.
