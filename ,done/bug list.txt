urgent bugs:

meh whatever bugs:
- fix up the font a bit more (Lv, PKMN, POKEBLOCK, parentheses, colon, semicolon, &)
- pokedex searching in general (fix up the order lists)
- fog doesn't address loading a few different palettes.  it also definitely doesn't support any sort of dynamic system that may happen in the future
- animation for sticky barb sticking doesn't work like thief's entirely, currently the animation is commented out
- the start menu doesn't have the correct palette loaded when more than 2 ow particles are loaded (like grass and dust from jumping)
- trying to save and then subsequently opening up the options menu causes the camera to stop panning with the player.  something to do with textboxes?
- meowstic gender difference

TODO:
- load different icons based on major gender difference
- giratina/arceus formes, form(e)s in general
- daycare effects for destiny knot & power items

TENTATIVE PLAN:

3.5 - BATTLE BUGS
 - at least get placeholder stuff in there
 - formes

4 - finish up items
5 - finish up abilities
6 - moves
7 - decide tms/hms

BATTLE BUGS:
all moves above psycho boost can and will freeze the game
selfdestruct doesn't kill the user
never miss moves always have been missing
experience gained for the medium slow group is weird

ITEM EXPANSION PROGRESS:
10/?

MOVE EXPANSION PROGRESS:
2/?

POKEMON EXPANSION PROGRESS:
practically done
