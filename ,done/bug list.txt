currently known:

- fog doesn't address loading a few different palettes.  it also definitely doesn't support any sort of dynamic system that may happen in the future
- animation for sticky barb sticking doesn't work like thief's entirely, currently the animation is commented out

TODO:
- daycare effects for destiny knot & power items
- giratina/arceus formes

TENTATIVE PLAN:
1 - give all the items their descriptions
2 - start on new moves, at least add entries for each of them (akin to abilities right now)
3 - pok√©mon expansion (!)
4 - finish up items
5 - finish up abilities
6 - moves
