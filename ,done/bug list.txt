currently known:

- fog doesn't address loading a few different palettes.  it also definitely doesn't support any sort of dynamic system that may happen in the future
- item name isn't buffered correctly on first turn when power herb activates
- animation for sticky barb sticking doesn't work like thief's entirely, currently the animation is commented out
