urgent bugs:
- messing around with too much in the start menu stuff causes the camera to stop panning
- i broke leveling up

meh whatever bugs:
- fix up the font a bit more (Lv, PKMN, POKEBLOCK, parentheses, colon, semicolon, &, pp)
- pokedex searching in general (fix up the order lists)
- animation for sticky barb sticking doesn't work like thief's entirely, currently the animation is commented out

day/night bugs:
- every blending thing needs to be adapted for the new dynamic palette system
- when an applymovement is used, the player gets blended with the colors (when inside)
- when a battle starts, the black covering is still blended

TODO:
- 79 MORE MOVE ANIMATIONS
- load different icons based on major gender difference
- meowstic/wormadam gender difference
- giratina/arceus formes, form(e)s in general
- daycare effects for destiny knot & power items

BATTLE BUGS:
MOVE_TARGET_USER & MOVE_TARGET_SELECTED bring up a selection even when in single battles
experience broke


move animations that i personally want to polish:
gyro ball (new particle?)
punishment is slash w a purple blend

move effects that need to be polished:
gravity
 - needs a 5/3 accuracy boost
 - needs to cancel out bounce, fly, splash, high/jump kick, telekinesis, sky drop, & flying press
