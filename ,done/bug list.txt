urgent bugs:

meh whatever bugs:
- fix up the font a bit more (Lv, PKMN, POKEBLOCK, parentheses, colon, semicolon, &)
- pokedex searching in general (fix up the order lists)
- fog needs to be adapted for the new dynamic palette system
- animation for sticky barb sticking doesn't work like thief's entirely, currently the animation is commented out
- trying to save and then subsequently opening up the options menu causes the camera to stop panning with the player (on frame type 2?  what?)
  - what the fuck i literally can't even reproduce this one consistently anymore
- meowstic gender difference

polishing:
- the day/night blending could use some polish
- start menu is super inefficient

TODO:
- load different icons based on major gender difference
- giratina/arceus formes, form(e)s in general
- daycare effects for destiny knot & power items

TENTATIVE PLAN:

3.5 - BATTLE BUGS
 - formes
 
6 - moves (haha didn't see THAT one coming did ya?)
 - animations
 - effects
   - setroost
   - setgravity

4 - finish up items
5 - finish up abilities
7 - decide tms/hms

BATTLE BUGS:
MOVE_TARGET_USER & MOVE_TARGET_SELECTED bring up a selection even when in single battles
experience gained for the medium slow group is weird

ITEM EXPANSION PROGRESS:
10/?

MOVE EXPANSION PROGRESS:
2/?

POKEMON EXPANSION PROGRESS:
practically done

move animations that i personally want to polish:
gyro ball (new particle)
