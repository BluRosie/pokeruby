urgent bugs:

meh whatever bugs:
- fix up the font a bit more (Lv, PKMN, POKEBLOCK, parentheses, colon, semicolon, &)
- pokedex searching in general (fix up the order lists)
- fog needs to be adapted for the new dynamic system
- animation for sticky barb sticking doesn't work like thief's entirely, currently the animation is commented out
- trying to save and then subsequently opening up the options menu causes the camera to stop panning with the player (on frame type 2?  what?)
  - what the fuck i literally can't even reproduce this one anymore
- meowstic gender difference

polishing:
- the day/night blending could use some polish
- start menu is super inefficient

TODO:
- load different icons based on major gender difference
- giratina/arceus formes, form(e)s in general
- daycare effects for destiny knot & power items

TENTATIVE PLAN:

3.5 - BATTLE BUGS
 - at least get placeholder stuff in there
 - formes

4 - finish up items
5 - finish up abilities
6 - moves
7 - decide tms/hms

BATTLE BUGS:
all moves above psycho boost can and will freeze the game
selfdestruct doesn't kill the user
never miss moves always have been missing
experience gained for the medium slow group is weird

ITEM EXPANSION PROGRESS:
10/?

MOVE EXPANSION PROGRESS:
2/?

POKEMON EXPANSION PROGRESS:
practically done
