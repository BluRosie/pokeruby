# Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire

Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, but with various edits to show off just what is all super easily done with a decompilation.
Everything here is public to use, no permission required.

Current implemented features:
* a ton of decapitalization
* moves are mostly updated to current generation, exceptions noted in src/data/battle_moves.c
* gen vi exp. share, toggleable from the bag and everything
* poison fades after reaching 1 hp in the overworld
* ball expansion
* hidden abilities
* gen 4 bike (toggle between acro and mach using the r button)
* run toggle using the r button
* fix snow
* add fog (replaces weather_fog_3)
* add snow and fog corresponding to in-battle
* gender differences

In Progress:
* ability expansion (thanks znogyrop and dizzy for ability descriptions)
* item expansion - maybe item pictures too?
* move expansion (thanks dizzy)
* eventually, pokémon expansion (huge thanks to lunos)

It builds the following rom:

* pokeruby.gba
