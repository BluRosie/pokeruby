# Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire

Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, but with various edits to show off just what is all super easily done with a decompilation.
Everything here is public to use, no permission required.  Only requirement is that the credits are given where credits are due.

Current implemented features:
* gen vi exp. share, toggleable from the bag and everything
* poison fades after reaching 1 hp in the overworld
* ball expansion
* hidden abilities
* gen 4 bike (toggle between acro and mach using the r button)
* run toggle using the r button
* fix snow (an even better way because of BigAngryDev)
* add fog (replaces weather_fog_3)
* add snow and fog corresponding to in-battle
* gender differences
* redesigned party menus
* fairy type
* day/night system 100% based on the rtc
* support for up to 128 TM's
* move expansion through gen 4 (with dummy data for all else)
* pokémon expansion through gen 4 (with dummy data for all else)
* item expansion through gen 4 (with dummy data for all else)
* an option to fully control the opposing trainer's party, including randomizing every aspect

In Progress:
* ability expansion (thanks znogyrop and dizzy for ability descriptions)
* item expansion - maybe item pictures too? (all battle items in gen iv have been implemented)

This ROM will build with a lot of unused data:
* abilities/moves/items/pokemon from gen v and up.  these are actually just entirely incomplete and placeholders for if i decide to complete them in the future.


It builds the following rom:

* pokeruby.gba

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).
